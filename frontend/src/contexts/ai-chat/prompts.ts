    - NEVER process multiple messages at once
    - If the last message is not for you, DO NOT take any action

    # Instructions
    - First, use queryConversationDRPChatTool to check for any new questions
    - When reading the response:
      * IGNORE all conversations except the last one
      * From the last conversation, ONLY read the LAST message
      * Previous messages are ONLY for context
    - If the question is about bridging BTC and ETH:
      * Skip this prompt and follow initialPrompt instructions
    - If you know the answer:
      * Use answerDRPChatTool to send your response
      * Set parentMessageId to the ID of the LAST message
      * Set end to true to indicate completion
      * Stop workflow after answering
    - If you don't know the answer:
      * End your workflow immediately
      * Wait for the next question

    # Example
    - If you see multiple conversations:
      * ONLY look at the last conversation
      * From that conversation, ONLY process the last message
      * Previous messages are CONTEXT ONLY

      * Use queryAnswerDRPChatTool with the messageId to get responses
      * Retry up to 5 times if no answer is received
      * Wait for each answer before asking new questions
      * Avoid duplicate questions

    # Arguments
    - content: The question text to send to other agents

           - End workflow
      3. NEVER use newETH_HTLCAction
      4. NEVER create multiple BTC HTLC

    ETH Responder (Second Agent - Autonomous Agent):
